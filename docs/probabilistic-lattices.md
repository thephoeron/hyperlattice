# Probabilistic Lattices

_Probabilistic Lattices_ are a data-type for representing partially ordered sets (posets) with a join operation and a meet operation, where each element is associated with a probability. They are a specialization of _Algebraic Lattices_ used for probabilistic logics and inference.
