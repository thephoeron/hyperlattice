# Generalized Lattices

_Generalized Lattices_ are a data-type for representing partially ordered sets (posets) with a join operation and a meet operation. They are a generalization of both _Algebraic Lattices_ and _Algebraic Hyperlattices_ to allow for non-unique joins and meets, providing a consistent interface for lattices of arbitrary dimension.
