# Hyperlattice: User's Guide

The `HYPERLATTICE` library provides Generalized Algebraic Lattice data-types for Common Lisp, including Lattices, Hyperlattices, and Probabilistic Hyperlattices.

This manual provides an overview of the interface and implementation of generalized lattices, the use of included functions for manipulating these data-types, and many examples of their real-world applications, including example source-code and algorithm specifications.
