# Posets (Partially Ordered Sets)

A Partially Ordered Set (or Poset) is a set of elements with a binary relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. A Poset is a generalization of a set with a total order, such as the set of integers with the less-than-or-equal-to relation, and a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where the binary relation is the reachability relation.
